AWS Services Integration

Amazon RDS

Hosts the MYSQL database
Configuration in appsettings.json:
json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "PropertyGallaContext": "Host=rds-instance.endpoint.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com;Database=propertygalla;Username=admin;Password=securepassword"
}
Amazon S3

Stores property images
Configured via AWS SDK:
csharp
services.AddAWSService<IAmazonS3>();
AWS Lambda

Handles image processing and other serverless functions
Triggered via S3 events or API Gateway
Elastic Beanstalk

Deployment platform for the ASP.NET application
Environment variables configured in the EB console
Deployment

Prerequisites:
AWS account with necessary permissions
AWS CLI configured
Elastic Beanstalk CLI tools installed
Deployment Steps:
bash
# Package the application
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish

# Zip the published files
cd ./publish
zip -r ../propertygalla.zip .

# Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk
eb init -p asp.net-core-linux propertygalla-backend
eb create propertygalla-prod
eb deploy
Development Setup

Prerequisites:
.NET 8 SDK
MYSQL
AWS CLI (for local development with AWS services)
Setup:
bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PropertyGallaBackEnd.git
cd PropertyGallaBackEnd

# Install dependencies
dotnet restore

# Configure database connection
# Update appsettings.Development.json with your local DB credentials

# Run migrations
dotnet ef database update

# Run the application
dotnet run
Environment Variables:
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: Development/Production
JWT__Key: Secret key for JWT tokens
JWT__Issuer: Token issuer
JWT__Audience: Token audience
AWS__AccessKey: AWS access key
AWS__SecretKey: AWS secret key
Security Considerations

# JWT Configuration:
Tokens expire after 1 hour
Strong secret key required
HTTPS mandatory in production

# Data Protection:
All passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256
Sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest

# API Security:
Role-based authorization
Input validation on all endpoints
Rate limiting recommended (implement via AWS API Gateway)

# AWS Best Practices:
Least privilege IAM roles
RDS in private subnet
S3 bucket policies with proper access controls
